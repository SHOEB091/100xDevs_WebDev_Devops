// The Dom or Document Object Model , is a programming interface for web documents.
// It reperesents the structure of a when page as a tree of objects.

// Why DOM?
// The DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects, allowing scripts to manipulate the content and structure dynamically. This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML.
